🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using multiple machine learning models. The dataset has been thoroughly preprocessed and enhanced with custom feature engineering to improve model performance and interpretability.

🔍 Project Highlights
	•	🔢 Models Used:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	•	Decision Tree
	•	Gradient Boosting Classifier
	•	🛠️ Techniques Applied:
	•	Data cleaning and preprocessing
	•	Outlier detection and removal
	•	Feature engineering (BMI categories, glucose levels, etc.)
	•	One-hot encoding of categorical features
	•	Train-test split evaluation
	•	Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports for evaluation

📁 Dataset

Used the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes features like:
	•	Glucose
	•	BMI
	•	Insulin
	•	Age
	•	Skin Thickness
	•	Diabetes Pedigree Function

📈 Goal

To create a robust binary classification system that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on clinical parameters.
